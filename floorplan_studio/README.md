# Floorplan Studio

Draw your home's floor plan in the browser, bind rooms and devices to Home
Assistant entities, and generate a live Lovelace dashboard from the same
renderer that drew the plan.

> **Alpha, version 0.0.1 — tested on a real home, and ready to try.** The
> editor, the MCP endpoint, the dashboard installer and the cards it generates
> have run end to end on a real Home Assistant OS installation. Its stage is
> `experimental` on purpose: one home is one home, and release packaging is
> still being finished.
>
> Expect rough edges, and generate to a **new** dashboard path rather than over
> one you rely on. You can try the generated dashboard first in the
> [live demo](https://karthikbabuks.github.io/floorplan-studio/demo/); the
> repository root says exactly where the testing has reached.

## What it does

- Multi-floor plans with rectangular and polygonal rooms, doors,
  windows, openings, walls and railings.
- A 261-entry library of devices, fixtures and furniture, each drawn as the
  object it is rather than as a labelled dot.
- 178 floor finishes on every horizontal surface — room floors, stair treads and
  landings, and the tops of walls.
- Entity binding, with live state drawn on the plan — including templated value
  labels, per-gang wall switches, daylight and artificial-light modelling.
- One-press generation of a Lovelace dashboard, one view per floor: the live
  plan, a house card with who is home and what is on, a popup per room with
  its scenes and scripts, and a one-sentence snapshot of each floor.
- An MCP endpoint, so an AI can draw the plan instead of you dragging shapes —
  working object by object through stable ids rather than rewriting the file.
- Review notes pinned to anything on the plan: a floor, a room, one lamp, a
  window, a stretch of wall, or a bare point. An assistant reads them back with
  the room they are about and what stands near them, and they are stripped from
  everything the app writes to Home Assistant.

## Installing

The app is reached from the Home Assistant sidebar through Ingress — there is
no separate login and no port to open for the editor itself.

1. Open **Settings → Apps → Install app**, then add this repository from
   **⋮ → Repositories**.
2. Install **Floorplan Studio**.
3. Start it, then open **Floorplan** in the sidebar.

## Configuration

| Option | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `log_level` | `info` | How much the app writes to its log. |
| `entity_refresh_seconds` | `60` | How long the entity catalogue and state snapshot are cached. |
| `mcp_enabled` | `true` | Serves `/mcp` for AI clients. Off means the path answers 404. |
| `mcp_allow_dashboard_install` | `false` | Lets an MCP client write a dashboard. Off, the tool is not even listed. |
| `headless_endpoints_enabled` | `false` | Serves `/app-api/v1` — REST plus a WebSocket — for a native or remote client that is not a browser inside Ingress. Off, those paths answer 404 on every port. Deliberately separate from `mcp_enabled`: an AI client and a phone are different callers that merely share a listener. |
| `ssl_cert`, `ssl_key` | empty | Name a cert/key in Home Assistant's shared `ssl` folder to also serve MCP and the headless API over HTTPS. |
| `mcp_ssl_port` | `8443` | Port for that HTTPS listener. Only used when both of the above are set. |

Full documentation is in [DOCS.md](DOCS.md), which Home Assistant also shows in
the app's **Documentation** tab.

## Help

Every panel and dialog in the editor has a **?** beside it that opens what
applies *there*; the **?** button in the top bar opens the whole index, and the
**⌨** button — or the `?` key — lists every key and gesture.

The same text is published as a
[help site](https://karthikbabuks.github.io/floorplan-studio/) and served to AI
clients through `get_help`, so the editor, the site and your assistant cannot
tell you three different things.

## What it can and cannot touch

The app's access to Home Assistant state is read-only by construction: one
request function, and it can only issue a GET. The single thing it writes is a
Lovelace dashboard, only when you press **Generate dashboard**, only to the path
you name, and only after backing up whatever was there.

The dashboard it generates is a different matter and is meant to be pressable —
tapping a light on the finished plan turns that light on, in your browser, under
your own Home Assistant session. `DOCS.md` explains where that line falls.
